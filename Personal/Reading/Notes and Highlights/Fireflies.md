The seventeen moras are divided into three verses of five, seven and five. An expert calligrapher can lay down the Japanese characters in such a way that they are taken in almost at a single glance. Language and perception conjoined. So it is impossible to translate a haiku, to write a haiku. Our language dilates, delays, demurs what should be a clean tock! on the Zen wood. These three words that can be perceived at a glance: that is as far as the impossible translation of a haiku can go. Conventionally, versions of haikus in Western languages use three verses of five, seven and five syllables each. But this is a pretty poor and distant imitation of their true attributes, even though curiously enough they tend to be shorter when read out loud.

Beuys removes his felt hat and holds it to his chest. The woman gazes at the scars and understand what she needs to understand. The hare understands art. Is there anything to understand? Without the slightest doubt, art is the answer. What we can’t be sure about is the question.

A very curious thing: nobody this century has produced more images than the iconoclastic Islamists who demolished the Twin Towers. The most famous of these images is without question that of the man falling headlong. At the other end of the lens is Richard Drew, a photographer who knows he’s never going to win the Pulitzer for this.

It’s a well-known line: there are no atheists in foxholes. God, like fireflies, only shines in the darkness, wrote Schopenhauer. In the trenches, the only light is that of enemy fire. Up there in space, where the darkness is total, travelling at over 16,500 miles per hour in a tiny craft that will reach a temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius when it re-enters the atmosphere, with no computer to control the descent, Yuri Gagarin declares, without ceremony, in a firm voice despite being curled up in a near-foetal position, I see no God up here. That’s what you call having balls.

Yuri Gagarin’s capsule landed in Tajtarova, Siberia. A peasant woman saw his parachute descend from just 200 metres away. Open-mouthed, she approaches him and asks if he has come from heaven. Certainly I have, Gagarin replies with his famous smile. This anecdote was obligatory reading in Russian schools until at least 1989. Have you seen my Ivan? The peasant woman asks. (We have left the printed page behind.) Gagarin stares at her incredulously. Ivan? Yes, my Ivan. He froze to death in Kolyma. Have you seen him? Have you seen my Ivan? Gagarin knows the answer but remains silent.

There is a giant, unalterable and illegible haiku above our heads every night. A haiku that moves with the slowness of honey, as if waiting for someone able to catch it.
