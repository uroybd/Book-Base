All day, this poem about Kabul has been bouncing around in my head. Saib-e-Tabrizi wrote it back in the seventeenth century, I think. I used to know the whole poem, but all I can remember now is two lines:"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls."
