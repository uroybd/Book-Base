There were some good poems in this collection. However, nothing compared to [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Book of Disquiet_ The Complete Edition by Fernando Pessoa|The Book of Disquiet]].

This is what I have to say about the stylistic aspects of the volume in question. It should be taken with a fair amount of skepticism due to the fact that it is (a) a translation, and (b) a translation by a different translator.

Pessoa's use of heteronyms is fascinating, to say the least. They have their distinct style, lifestyle, and even biographies. However, reading these poems from various times and signed by various heteronyms, converges to say something singular in nature:

![[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe#Page 29 @ 28 June 2023 01:30:04 AM]]

Most of his poems in this collection, and arguably most he has written in his lifetime are about this materialism (or **empiricism** perhaps?). While The Book of Disquiet is all about one's inner life, and dreams, these poems are all about one's outer life, often in strong denial of an existence of an inner life.

Offering a unique sampling of his most famous voices, this collection features Pessoa’s major, best-known works and several stunning poems that have come to light only in this century, including his long, highly autobiographical swan song. Featuring a rich body of work that has never before been translated into English, this is the finest introduction available to the stunning breadth of Pessoa’s genius.
