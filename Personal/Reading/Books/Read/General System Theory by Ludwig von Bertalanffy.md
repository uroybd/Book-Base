This book neither dives deep into the subject nor is a textbook. It is more of an overview of the subject and a survey of the state of its development.

In various branches of science, we encounter systems regularly. Von Bertalanffy defines systems[^1] as such:

![[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/General System Theory_  Foundations, Development, Applications#^82aa6e]]

According to von Bertalanffy, some phenomena can only be understood/interpreted at the system level:

![[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/General System Theory_  Foundations, Development, Applications#^2ac684]]

 His aim was to establish a theory for systems that is applicable to all systems.

The implication of this idea is a [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn#^3d1f04|paradigm shift]]. But, this is not only an ambitious idea. The author, using his multidisciplinary knowledge, mathematics, and reasoningâ€” has given a sufficiently compelling demonstration of what he wanted to achieve.

I will not agree with everything the author said, though. For example, he was unable to see how music, culture etc. are useful for survival:

![[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/General System Theory_  Foundations, Development, Applications#^4d8ec4]]

Culture actually is very important for our survival. It enables us to achieve higher, and more complex organisation, often spanning lifetimes of multiple generations.

But these are minor things. His main point remains valid. If we think from a system perspective, many of our current ideas will need radical reevaluation. The author reevaluated *stress* like this:

![[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/General System Theory_  Foundations, Development, Applications#^8d3ac9|General System Theory_  Foundations, Development, Applications]]

In this light, modern approaches to creating a *stress-free* environment seem not only unnecessary but even harmful.

Von Bertelanffy belonged to an age when scientists used to study not only their own little scoped part of science but science in general, philosophy, art, and life as a whole. He had his failings and moments of shameful inhumanity.[^2] But, academically, he was one of the finest of his age. It shows in his work.
